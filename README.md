## Uperqt - BA thesis
- Game engine: __Unity__
- Contribution: __Louis BANDELIER__

A collaboration with [Cod.Act](https://codact.ch/en/) for their UPERQT project featuring a duel between two real robots.
The goal was to develop an artificial intelligence to handle the robots' behaviors.
In the end, a reinforcement learning approach gave them both precise and organic movements and allowed them to constantly adapt to each others.  
**Keywords**: Articulated Robot, Machine learning, Reinforcment Learning, ML-Agents, Unity.
